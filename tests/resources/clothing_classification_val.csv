15459,974,50,Great blazer/jacket,I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.,5,1,12,General,Jackets,Jackets
8569,952,36,Nice details,"This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy, and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it, like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible, but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected, and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi",3,1,0,General,Tops,Sweaters
2834,1004,43,Eh...,"This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!",2,0,6,General,Bottoms,Skirts
4423,1081,39,A little disappointed.,"I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print, but when i finally received, i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model, so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on",3,1,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
12352,1078,39,On my wish list,"I tried this on in the store, in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one, i could go either way.

the cut is flattering fit and flare, and the colors are rich. i like the ""flowery"" design, good spring piece in my opinion, as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material, buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy, very soft. not too flimsy iether.",4,1,13,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

8545,873,38,Great top - wish it came in more colors,"This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well, not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i don't mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi",5,1,6,General,Tops,Knits
