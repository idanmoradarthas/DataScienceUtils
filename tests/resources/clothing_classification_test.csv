16339,867,50,Very easy to wear,"The material is soft (maybe not the best quality) and the cut is easy to wear. i have both colors and love them...they wash nicely and i like the ""baseball"" cut at the bottom. i especially like the print at the neck line...very cute and feminine.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits
1246,850,29,,"This top is such a great color and style. i did have to go a size down, as i typically wear a medium. the style is very forgiving. it looks great with shorts and jeans! it's staple!",4,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
16111,1083,47,Size up if you want to sit down,"I love the dress enough to go on a diet. i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear. i hate skin tight clothing, and wear a 0 in everything else - the 2 made me feel as if you could see my cervix. i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a 0 - something happened with this dress.",4,1,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
2858,573,39,A-mazing!!!!!,"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!",5,1,4,General Petite,Trend,Trend
332,866,46,Really good quality tee!,I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.,5,1,5,General,Tops,Knits
7811,928,53,Very soft,"I loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package. it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time. i am 5'3 102lbs and purchased the xs. the arm length was perfect. the sweater length hit slightly above my hips. the style of the sweater is a bit boxy, but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent.",4,1,1,General,Tops,Sweaters
5020,1095,53,Adorable,"Wanted to buy this dress, but the bust area was way too small. as i went up sizes, the torso began to be too long, and i would have to have it altered, i guess. what a shame.
but, if you are small chested, then this is your dress.",5,1,0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

11442,825,56,Not for the busty,"Pros: pretty, nicely made.

cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.",3,0,5,General,Tops,Blouses
8888,1020,56,,"I think i wanted a skirt like this in the 1980s. with its aged denim and retro style, it looks like i've had it all that time. i couldn't zip my usual 4 but the 6 is comfortable if a bit snug, sitting right at my natural waist. it's flattering and shows off my waist with tops tucked in, something i never do with my other skirts, which all sit lower. i like how it flares a little oddly due to the horizontal seam. it's interesting and different. i will wear it in summer with sandals and it will lo",5,1,0,General,Bottoms,Skirts
4955,1110,27,This color is everything!,"This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow, but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine, especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric, but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally, the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!",5,1,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
